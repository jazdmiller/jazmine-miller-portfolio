# Portfolio
Showcase of my projects built with React, Vite, JSX, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, GSAP. Deployed with Firebase.

## Description
I wanted my portfolio to embody a sleek, minimal aesthetic, enhancing the user experience and focusing more attention on my showcased projects. By opting for a more clean layout, I aimed to create an uncluttered digital space that enables visitors to intuitively navigate and explore my work.
